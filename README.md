Hi, I'm **Gurudas Ashok Prabhu**, a **hands-on Solution Architect** with over 8 years of experience in cloud architecture design and a passion for continuous learning and exploring new technologies.

My journey began as a Backend Development Engineer, working with C# and Microsoft stacks, which gave me a strong foundation in software development and designing large-scale solutions. Over the years, I transitioned into cloud technologies, where I specialize in building and refactoring IT systems to unlock their full potential in the cloud.

I have extensive experience in:
* Cloud Migrations: Transforming monolithic applications into sleek, cloud-based microservices and performing lift-and-shift migrations of legacy applications to AWS and Azure.
* AWS Cloud Administration: Proficient in services such as EC2, S3, VPC, RDS, DynamoDB, IAM, Route 53, CloudFormation, CloudFront, CloudWatch, and more.
* Monitoring & Optimization: Skilled in tools like Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger, and AWS monitoring solutions to build scalable, maintainable, and cost-efficient systems.
* Adept in Docker for container management and adopting DevOps practices, including CI/CD pipelines, to streamline development and deployment processes and Kubernetes for Container Orchestration platform.
* Expertise in Cloud Cost Optimization and Cost Management.
* Exceptional ability to communicate complex technical concepts and collaborate with cross-functional teams.
* Proficiency in infrastructure automation tools like CloudFormation.
* Adept at conducting technical and leadership training to bridge skill gaps and enhance team performance.

As a cloud enthusiast, I share my knowledge through blogs on AWS services and hands-on tutorials on platforms like Medium and GitHub, empowering others to navigate cloud technologies with ease.
